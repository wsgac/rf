* RF - Dormand-Prince algorithm for solving nonstiff systems of differential equations

** Installation and loading
   This project is meant to be loaded via Quicklisp. Having cloned the
   repository, make sure it can be reached by Quicklisp (this might
   involve pushing a directory pathname to
   =asdf:*central-registry*=. After that you should be able to do:
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (ql:quickload :rf)
   #+END_SRC

** Usage
   The entry point is the function =run-driver=, which requires
   passing a driver function, initial parameters and an output file
   path. After the computation terminates, results should be available
   in tabulated form in the output file.

** Motivation
   This library was written as part of my BSc thesis with the
   additional hope of demonstrating the use of Common Lisp for
   scientific computing.
